## Code of Conduct
We at the SRIOV-FEC community adhere to [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as our Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it. Please read [the full text](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Maintainers
Maintainers act as the gatekeeper to the code - ensuring that coding standards, quality, and functionality of code are maintained by the contributors. Any additions to the source code must be approved by the appropriate maintainer before they are added. The maintainers' role include:

* Ensuring that any code submitted is of the appropriate quality.
* Ensuring that any code submitted is accompanied with appropriate documentation.
* Ensuring that any code submitted has been reviewed by peers.
* Ensuring that the relevant documentation is kept up to date with the code.
* Ensuring that any identified bugs in the relevant code are captured in the issues backlog.
* Ensuring that the unit, integration, and regression tests are appropriate for the relevant components.
* Ensuring that the contribution does not infringe others' Intellectual Property or the appropriate license and that it is in compliance with [Developer Certificate of Origin](http://developercertificate.org/).
* Answering questions/emails on the relevant areas of the SRIOV-FEC code base.

## Submitting Changes
Inbound contributions are done through [pull requests](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/sriov-fec-operator/pulls) which include code changes, enhancements, bug fixes or new applications/features. If you are getting started, you may refer to Github's [how-to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). With your contributions, we expect that you:

* certify that you wrote and/or have the right to submit the pull request,
* agree with the [Developer Certificate of Origin](http://developercertificate.org/),
* sign-off your contribution with `Signed-off-by` tag in the commit message(s)
* comply with SRIOV-FEC [licensing](#license),
* pass all Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools' checks,
* test and verify the proper behaviour of your code, and
* accompany the contribution with good quality documentation.

Signing off the contribution is performed by the command `git commit --signoff` which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source contribution.

Application contributors have the implicit commitment to continually support their applications in whenever a bug is discovered or a test is broken due to the publication of a new release.

It is always admired when application contributors provide end-to-end acceptance test methods.

Big contributions, ideas or controversial features should be discussed with the developers' community and with the Technical Steering Committee through a Request for Comments (RFC). This is an essential early step to bring everybody to a common level of understanding so that when the final implementation is pushed, there will be common consensus of the acceptability of the contribution and smooth integration of it to the mainline. Requests for Comments should be submitted through a pull request prefixed with `[RFC]` in the title.

## Contribution Acceptance Flow
1. A contributor creates a pull request with their changes.
2. Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools will be automatically triggered and their results are returned into the pull request.
3. The contributor resolves all findings reported by CI/CD verifications.
4. The contributor invites reviewers to the pull request and addresses their comments/feedback.
5. Every pull request must receive 2 approvals in order to go forward with merging.
6. The maintainer(s) must review and ensure that the change(s) introduced by the pull request meets the acceptance criteria.
6. Merging the pull requests can only be performed by the maintainer(s).

## How to report an issue/bug/enhancement
It is encouraged to use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/sriov-fec-operator/issues) tool to report any bug, issue, enhancement or to seek help.

## Style Guide / Coding conventions
All contributions must follow the [Development Guide](DEVELOPING.md).
