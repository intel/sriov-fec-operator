## Overview

This document provides the instructions for using the SRIOV-FEC Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators in Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes. This operator was developed with aid of the Operator SDK project.

## SRIOV-FEC Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators

The role of the SRIOV-FEC Operator for Intel Wireless FEC Accelerator is to orchestrate and manage the resources/devices exposed by a range of Intel's vRAN FEC acceleration devices/hardware within the OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster. The operator is a state machine which will configure the resources and then monitor them and act autonomously based on the user interaction.
The operator design of the SRIOV-FEC Operator for Intel Wireless FEC Accelerator supports the following vRAN FEC accelerators:

* [Intel速 vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100](https://github.com/intel/sriov-fec-operator/blob/master/spec/vran-accelerators-supported-by-operator.md#intel-vran-dedicated-accelerator-acc100)
* [Intel速 vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC200](https://github.com/intel/sriov-fec-operator/blob/master/spec/vran-accelerators-supported-by-operator.md#intel-vran-dedicated-accelerator-acc200)

### Wireless FEC Acceleration management

This operator handles the management of the FEC devices used to accelerate the FEC process in vRAN L1 applications - the FEC devices are provided by a designated hardware (ie. Intel速 vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100).
It provides functionality to create desired VFs (Virtual Functions) for the FEC device, binds them to appropriate drivers and configures the VF's queues for desired functionality in 4G or 5G deployment. 
It also deploys an instance of the [SR-IOV Network Device Plugin](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-device-plugin) which manages the FEC VFs as an OpenShift cluster resource and configures this device plugin to detect the resources. 
The user interacts with the operator by providing a CR (CustomResource). 
The operator constantly monitors the state of the CR to detect any changes and acts based on the changes detected. 
The CR is provided per cluster configuration. The components for individual nodes can be configured by specifying appropriate values for each component per "nodeSelector".
Once the CR is applied or updated, the operator/daemon checks if the configuration is already applied, and, if not it binds the PFs to driver, creates desired amount of VFs, binds them to driver and runs the [pf-bb-config utility](https://github.com/intel/pf-bb-config) to configure the VF queues to the desired configuration.

This operator is a common operator for FEC device/resource management for a range on accelerator cards. For specific examples of CRs dedicated to single accelerator card only see:

* [Sample CR for Wireless FEC (ACC100)](#sample-cr-for-wireless-fec-acc100)

The workflow of the SRIOV FEC operator is shown in the following diagram:
![SRIOV FEC Operator Design](images/sriov_fec_operator_acc100.png)

#### FEC Configuration

The Intel's vRAN FEC acceleration devices/hardware expose the FEC PF device which is to be bound to PCI-PF-STUB, IGB_UIO and VFIO-PCI in order to enable creation of the FEC VF devices. Once the FEC PF is bound to the correct driver, the user can create a number of devices to be used in Cloud Native deployment of vRAN to accelerate FEC. Once these devices are created they are to be bound to a user-space driver such as VFIO-PCI in order for them to work and be consumed in vRAN application pods. Before the device can be used by the application, the device needs to be configured - notably the mapping of queues exposed to the VFs - this is done via pf-bb-config application with the input from the CR used as a configuration.

> NOTE: For [Intel速 vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100](https://github.com/intel/sriov-fec-operator/blob/master/spec/vran-accelerators-supported-by-operator.md#intel-vran-dedicated-accelerator-acc100) it is advised to create all 16 VFs. The card is configured to provide up to 8 queue groups with up to 16 queues per group. The queue groups can be divided between groups allocated to 5G/4G and Uplink/Downlink, it can be configured for 4G or 5G only, or both 4G and 5G at the same time. Each configured VF has access to all the queues. Each of the queue groups has a distinct priority level. The request for given queue group is made from application level (ie. vRAN application leveraging the FEC device).

To get all the nodes containing one of the supported vRAN FEC accelerator devices run the following command (all the commands are run in the `vran-acceleration-operators` namespace, if operator is used on Kubernetes then use `kubectl` instead of `oc`):
```shell
[user@ctrl1 /home]# oc get sriovfecnodeconfig
NAME             CONFIGURED
node1            Succeeded
```

To find the PF of the SRIOV FEC accelerator device to be configured, run the following command:

```shell
[user@ctrl1 /home]# oc get sriovfecnodeconfig node1 -o yaml

***

```

To configure the FEC device with desired setting create a CR (An example below configures ACC100's 8/8 queue groups for 5G, 4 queue groups for Uplink and another 4 queues groups for Downlink), for the list of CRs applicable to all supported devices see:

* [Sample CR for Wireless FEC (ACC100)](#sample-cr-for-wireless-fec-acc100)

          numQueueGroups: 4
          numAqsPerGroups: 16
          aqDepthLog2: 4
```

To apply the CR run:

```shell
[user@ctrl1 /home]# oc apply -f <sriovfec_cr_name>.yaml
```

After creation of the CR, the SRIOV FEC daemon starts configuring the FEC device. Once the SRIOV FEC configuration is complete, the following status is reported:

```shell
[user@ctrl1 /home]# oc get sriovfecnodeconfig
NAME             CONFIGURED
node1            Succeeded
```

From SRIOV FEC daemon pod, the user should see logs similar to the output below, if the VF queues were successfully programmed. For a list of sample log outputs for applicable devices see:

* [Sample Daemon log for Wireless FEC (ACC100)](#sample-daemon-log-for-wireless-fec-acc100)

The user can observe the change of the cards FEC configuration. The created devices should appear similar to the following output (The '0d5c' is a PF of the FEC device and the '0d5d' is a VF of the FEC device). For a list of sample status output for applicable devices see:

#### SRIOV Device Plugin

As part of the SRIOV FEC operator the K8s SRIOV Network Device plugin is being deployed. The plugin is configured to detect the FEC devices only and is being configured according to the CR. This deployment of the SRIOV Network Device plugin does not manage non-FEC devices. For more information, refer to the documentation for [SRIOV Network Device plugin](https://github.com/openshift/sriov-network-device-plugin). After the deployment of the Operator and update/application of the CR, the user will be able to detect the FEC VFs as allocatable resources in the OpenShift cluster. The output should be similar to this (`intel.com/intel_fec_acc100` or alternative for a different FEC accelerator):

```shell
[user@node1 /home]# oc get node <node_name> -o json | jq '.status.allocatable'
{
  "cpu": "95500m",
  "ephemeral-storage": "898540920981",
  "hugepages-1Gi": "30Gi",
  "intel.com/intel_fec_acc100": "16",
  "memory": "115600160Ki",
  "pods": "250"
}
```

Once the SRIOV operator takes care of setting up and configuring the device, user can test the device using a sample 'test-bbdev' application from the [DPDK project (DPDK 20.11)](https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk/tree/v20.11/app/test-bbdev). An example of a prepared sample application's docker image can be found in [Intel速 SEO project github EdgeApps repo](https://github.com/smart-edge-open/edgeapps/tree/master/applications/fpga-sample-app). SEO is an edge computing software toolkit that enables highly optimized and performant edge platforms to on-board and manage applications and network functions with cloud-like agility across any type of network. For more information, go to [www.smart-edge-open.github.io](https://smart-edge-open.github.io/).

With a sample image of the DPDK application, the following pod can be created similar to the following file as an example (`intel.com/intel_fec_acc100` needs to be replaced as needed when different accelerator is used):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-bbdev-sample-app
spec:
  containers:
  - securityContext:
      privileged: false
      capabilities:
        add:
          - IPC_LOCK
          - SYS_NICE
    name: bbdev-sample-app
    image: bbdev-sample-app:1.0
    command: [ "sudo", "/bin/bash", "-c", "--" ]
    args: [ "while true; do sleep 300000; done;" ]
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /hugepages
      name: hugepage
    - name: class
      mountPath: /sys/devices
      readOnly: false
    resources:
      requests:
        intel.com/intel_fec_acc100: '1'
        hugepages-1Gi: 2Gi
        memory: 2Gi
      limits:
        intel.com/intel_fec_acc100: '1'
        hugepages-1Gi: 2Gi
        memory: 2Gi
  volumes:
  - name: hugepage
    emptyDir:
      medium: HugePages
  - hostPath:
      path: "/sys/devices"
    name: class
```

The pod consumes one of the FEC VF resources. Once the pod is created, user can detect the VF allocated to the pod by executing into pods terminal and running:

```shell
[user@ bbdev-sample-app /root]# printenv | grep INTEL_FEC
PCIDEVICE_INTEL_COM_INTEL_FEC_ACC100=0000:cb:00.0
```

With the PCIe B:D.F of the FEC VF allocated to the pod established, user will run the 'test-bbdev' application to test the device (similar output indicating that the tests are passing is expected):

Depending on PfDriver that you are using, you might have to add additional parameters to DPDK applications to make them work.

`pci-pf-stub` and `igb_uio` don't require additional parameters.
```shell
[root@pod-bbdev-sample-app ~]# ./test-bbdev.py --testapp-path ./dpdk-test-bbdev -e="-a 0000:cb:00.0" -n 1 -b 1 -l 1 -c validation
```
For `vfio-pci` uuid token is required (as described above), so `--vfio-vf-token` parameter is required.
```shell
[root@pod-bbdev-sample-app ~]# ./test-bbdev.py --testapp-path ./dpdk-test-bbdev -e="-a 0000:cb:00.0 --vfio-vf-token '02bddbbf-bbb0-4d79-886b-91bad3fbb510'" -n 1 -b 1 -l 1 -c validation

## Managing NIC Devices

The management of the NIC SRIOV devices/resources in the OpenShift cluster is out of scope of this operator. The user is expected to deploy an operator/[SRIOV Network Device plugin](https://github.com/openshift/sriov-network-device-plugin) which will handle the orchestration of SRIOV NIC VFs between pods.

## VFIO_PCI Driver

### Secure Boot

Until SRIOV-FEC operator 2.3.0, `pf-bb-config` application which comes as part of SRIOV-FEC operator distribution, 
relied on MMIO access to the PF of the ACC100 (access through mmap of the PF PCIe BAR config space using igb_uio and/or pf_pci_stub drivers).

In case of enabled secure boot, this access is blocked by kernel through a feature called [lockdown](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/kernel_lockdown.7.html).
Lockdown mode automatically prevents relying on igb_uio and/or pf_pci_stub drivers due to the direct mmap.
In other words: when secure boot is enabled, this legacy usage is not supported.

To be able to support this special mode, `pf_bb_config` application has been enhanced (v22.03) and now it could use more secure approach relying on vfio-pci.  

| ![SRIOV FEC Operator Design](images/vfio/vfio-pci.svg) |
|------------------------------------------------------|

SRIOV-FEC operator 2.3.0 leverages enhancements provided by `pf_bb_config` and it provides support for vfio-pci driver. 
It means operator would work correctly on a platforms where secure boot is enabled.

'vfio-pci' driver support implemented in SRIOV-FEC operator 2.3.0 is visualized by diagram below:


| ![SRIOV FEC Operator Design](images/vfio/vfio-pci-support-in-operator.svg) |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Previously supported drivers `pci-pf-stub` and `igb_uio` are still supported by an operator, but they cannot be used together with secure boot feature.

### Vfio Token

Please be aware that usage of `vfio-pci` driver requires following arguments added to the kernel:
 - vfio_pci.enable_sriov=1
 - vfio_pci.disable_idle_d3=1

If `vfio-pci` PF driver is used, then access to VF requires `UUID` token. Token is identical for all nodes in cluster, has default value of `02bddbbf-bbb0-4d79-886b-91bad3fbb510` and could be changed by
    setting `SRIOV_FEC_VFIO_TOKEN` in `subscription.spec.config.env` field. Applications that are using VFs should provide token via EAL parameters - e.g
    `./test-bbdev.py -e="--vfio-vf-token=02bddbbf-bbb0-4d79-886b-91bad3fbb510 -a0000:f7:00.1"`

The `VFIO_TOKEN` can be fetched by "secret" using following commands, but this will be deprecated in future release due to security concern.

```shell
kubectl get secret vfio-token -o jsonpath='{.data.VFIO_TOKEN}' | base64 --decode
```

Sriov-network-device-plugin v4.14 has the capability to inject the VFIO token as an environment variable to the application pod. FEC Operator pointing to v4.14, leverages this feature to pass the VFIO token in more secured method to the application pods. You can use following commands to get the `VFIO_TOKEN` in application pods.

```shell
#Premise you have successfully configured fec-operator settings and enter an application pod
[root@pod:/home]# env | grep VFIO_TOKEN
PCIDEVICE_INTEL_COM_INTEL_FEC_ACC100_INFO={"0000:8b:01.5":{"extra":{"VFIO_TOKEN":"02bddbbf-bbb0-4d79-886b-91bad3fbb510"},"generic":{"deviceID":"0000:8b:01.5"},"vfio":{"dev-mount":"/dev/vfio/178","mount":"/dev/vfio/vfio"}},"0000:8b:01.7":{"extra":{"VFIO_TOKEN":"02bddbbf-bbb0-4d79-886b-91bad3fbb510"},"generic":{"deviceID":"0000:8b:01.7"},"vfio":{"dev-mount":"/dev/vfio/180","mount":"/dev/vfio/vfio"}}}
[root@pod:/home]# export VFIO_TOKEN=02bddbbf-bbb0-4d79-886b-91bad3fbb510
```

## Deploying the Operator

The SRIOV-FEC Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators is easily deployable from the OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster via provisioning and application of the following YAML spec files:

If operator is being installed on OpenShift, then follow [deployment steps for OpenShift](openshift-deployment.md).
Otherwise follow [steps for Kubernetes](kubernetes-deployment.md).

### Applying Custom Resources

Once the operator is successfully deployed, the user interacts with it by creating CRs which will be interpreted by the operators, for examples of CRs see the following section:
- [FEC Configuration](#fec-configuration)

To apply a CR run:

```shell
[user@ctrl1 /home]# oc apply -f <cr-name>
```

To view the status of current CR run (sample output):

```shell
[user@ctrl1 /home]# oc get sriovfecclusterconfig config -o yaml

### Telemetry
Operator exposes telemetry from pf-bb-config application for any supported card which uses `vfio-pci` PF driver in Prometheus format.
      It is available in `daemonset` container under `:8080/bbdevconfig` endpoint.
      By default endpoint updates metrics every 15 second, however this interval could be modified by
      changing value of `SRIOV_FEC_METRIC_GATHER_INTERVAL` env var in operators subscription.

There are 5 available metrics:
- bytes_processed_per_vfs - represents number of bytes that are processed by VF
  - `pci_address` - represents unique BDF for VF
  - `queue_type` - represents queue type for VF. Available values:
    - VRB1: `5GDL`, `5GUL`, `FFT`
    - VRB2: `5GDL`, `5GUL`, `FFT`, `4GDL`, `4GUL`, `MLD`
- code_blocks_per_vfs - number of code blocks processed by VF
  - `pci_address` - represents unique BDF for VF
  - `queue_type` - represents queue type for VF. Available values:
    - VRB1: `5GDL`, `5GUL`, `FFT`
    - VRB2: `5GDL`, `5GUL`, `FFT`, `4GDL`, `4GUL`, `MLD`
- counters_per_engine - number of code blocks processed by Engine
  - `engine_id` - represents integer ID of engine on card
  - `pci_address` - represents unique BDF for card on which engine is located
  - `queue_type` - represents queue type for VF. Available values:
    - VRB1: `5GDL`, `5GUL`, `FFT`
    - VRB2: `5GDL`, `5GUL`, `FFT`, `4GDL`, `4GUL`, `MLD`
- vf_count - describes number of configured VFs on card
  - `pci_address` - represents unique BDF for PF
  - `status` - represents current status of SriovFecNodeConfig. Available values: `InProgress`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Ignored`
- vf_status - equals to 1 if `status` is `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_CONFIGURED` or `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_ACTIVE` and 0 otherwise
  - `pci_address` - represents unique BDF for VF
  - `status` - represents status as exposed by pf-bb-config. Available values: `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_NOSTATUS`, `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_NOT_SUPPORTED`, `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_RESET`,
    `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_CONFIGURED`, `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_ACTIVE`, `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_FATAL_ERR`, `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_RESTART_REQ`, `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_RECONFIG_REQ`, `RTE_BBDEV_DEV_CORRECT_ERR`

Note: VRB1 can process 4G DL/UL operations but it does not have telemetry counters for such operations.

If SriovFecNodeConfig for node is in `Succeeded` state, then all those metrics are exposed
```
bytes_processed_per_vfs{pci_address="0000:cb:00.0",queue_type="5GUL"} 0
bytes_processed_per_vfs{pci_address="0000:cb:00.0",queue_type="5GDL"} 0
code_blocks_per_vfs{pci_address="0000:cb:00.0",queue_type="5GUL"} 0
code_blocks_per_vfs{pci_address="0000:cb:00.0",queue_type="5GDL"} 0
counters_per_engine{engine_id="0",pci_address="0000:ca:00.0",queue_type="5GUL"} 0
vf_count{pci_address="0000:ca:00.0",status="Succeeded"} 1
vf_status{pci_address="0000:cb:00.0",status="RTE_BBDEV_DEV_CONFIGURED"} 1
```
Otherwise only a `vf_count` metric is exposed
```
vf_count{pci_address="0000:ca:00.0",status="Failed"} 0
```

## Hardware Validation Environment

- Intel速 vRAN Dedicated Accelerator ACC100
- 2nd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 processor platform

## Summary

The SRIOV-FEC Operator for Wireless FEC Accelerators is a fully functional tool to manage the vRAN FEC resources autonomously in a Cloud Native OpenShift environment based on the user input.
The operator handles all the necessary actions from creation of FEC resources to configuration and management of the resources within the OpenShift cluster.

## Appendix 1 - Developer Notes

### Drain skip option

Using the option `spec.drainSkip: false` in CR will perform the [node drain](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_drain/) while applying the configuration. If you do not want to drain the node during the CR apply, set this option to `true` which is the default behavior.

- Reference CR for ACC200 (Deprecated)

>NOTE: Use of v2 API for ACC200 is deprecated and suggest to use vrb/v1 API going forward. However, to support the existing applications using acc200, fec/v2 API for ACC200 will be supported. But Intel strongly suggest the new users to use vrb/v1 API to configure the VRB1 devices. There is **NO** functional difference between vrb/v1 and fec/v2 API with respect to VRB1 accelerator device in the Operator.

## Appendix 4 - Additional instructions for applications using VF interface in case of VFIO mode

As described in [pf-bb-config application documentation](https://github.com/intel/pf-bb-config?tab=readme-ov-file#using-vfio-pci-driver),  In case of VFIO mode after applying the configuration through CR, pf-bb-config application runs in a daemon mode in side the Operator daemon POD all the time, and this is a must requirement for the DU application to be able to consciously use the VF interface.   Below are additional information and instructions that developer should be aware of while using VF interfaces in VFIO mode:

- If the user wants to update/modify existing accelerator configuration, DU application has to stop and release the VF resource before changing or deleting the configuration.
- It is not expected to happen that Operator daemon pod to be killed and restarted by itself, but for any external event reason (one such example is probe failures) if the daemon pod happens to be restarted, then pf-bb-config application run in the daemon mode will also be terminated and will be restarted and reconfigure the accelerator in the new instance of daemon pod that deployed automatically.
- In the event of daemon pod restarts, DU application may not be able to use the VF interface. To recover from this state, DU application should release the VF interface and reconfigure VF interface (or DU application terminate and restart) as referenced in pf-bb-config documentation.
- Reset of other Operator pods ie., manager and labeler will not cause any interruption for application to use VF interface.
