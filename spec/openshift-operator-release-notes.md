> **_Single Node OpenShift (SNO)_**
>
>Daemon part (running on each featured worker node) of operator drains a node (moves its workloads to another node) before applying requested configuration.  
>Node draining doesn't work on SNO deployment. Because of that, operator's API exposes `SriovFecClusterConfig.spec.drainSkip` parameter which stops daemon doing workload migration.
>In theory it is all what is needed to find operator usable on SNO, however, operator's validation cycle is executed _ONLY_ on multi-worker-node clusters.
>
> Team is working to incorporate SNO deployments to existing validation cycle in the nearest future.
