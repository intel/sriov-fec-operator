  description: The Silicom® FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card N5010 (Silicom® FPGA N5010) is a highly customizable FPGA SmartNIC which enables high-throughput, low latency and high-bandwith applications.  It allows the optimization of data plane performance to reduce total cost of ownership while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.  The Intel FPGA N5010 plays a key role in accelerating 5G and network functions virtualization (NFV) adoption for ecosystem partners such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers (TEMs) virtual network functions (VNF) vendors, system integrators and telcos, to bring scalable and high-performance solutions to market. The Intel FPGA N5010 includes a variant that is design to be Network Equipment Building System (NEBS)-friendly, and features a Root-of-Trust device that helps protect systems from FPGA host security exploits. This document explains how the FPGA resource can be used on the Open Network Edge Services Software (OpenNESS) platform for accelerating network functions and edge application workloads. We use the Intel® FPGA N5010 as a reference FPGA PAC and use LTE/5G Forward Error Correction (FEC) as an example workload that accelerates the 5G or 4G L1 base station network function. The same concept and mechanism is applicable for application acceleration workloads like AI and ML on FPGA for Inference applications. The Intel® FPGA N5010 is a full-duplex, 100 Gbps in-system, re-programmable acceleration card for multi-workload networking application acceleration. It has an optimal memory mixture designed for network functions, with an integrated network interface card (NIC) in a small form factor that enables high throughput, low latency, and low power per bit for a custom networking pipeline.
